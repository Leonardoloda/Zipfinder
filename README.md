## Description

Just a simple yarn monorepo to find the info for a zip code, to make it easier to verify; I've decided to add both apps into the same repo and enable yarn to be able to run both apps from the top level. 

## Server

For the backend, I've created a simple Apollo graph application with just one endpoint to create a robot. More info [here](./apollo-zip/README.md)

## Webapp

For the frontend, I've used React + Typescript to create a simple form inspired by old consoles. More info [here](./zippy/README.md)
